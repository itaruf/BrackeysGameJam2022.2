<h4>Game Design: Gameplay</h4>
<ul>
  <li>The player navigates through 5-minute enemy waves, utilizing resources obtained passively and from defeating enemies to activate abilities while avoiding weapon overheating. Difficulty ramps up with faster spawning AIs and more challenging enemy types. Defensive tactics include firing bullets, deploying healing zones, slowing time, and summoning allies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Level Features</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Set in a singular room level with strategic cover spots and a central house, emphasizing the importance of tactical positioning and the use of gravity mechanics for defensive maneuvers.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Game Mechanics: Movement</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Players can move freely in all directions and leverage jumping to gain strategic positions. Unlike players, NPCs lack the ability to jump, adding a layer of strategic depth to navigation and combat.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Abilities</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Includes a versatile arsenal: healing areas for recovery, turrets for autonomous defense, time-slowing for tactical advantage, and AI ally summoning for additional firepower, each with unique operational limits.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enemies' AI and Tactics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enemies are programmed to aggressively pursue the player but will prioritize any summoned allies, changing their focus based on dynamic in-game events and player actions.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Resource Management: Computing Power</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Computing Power, the main resource for ability activation, is accrued over time and through enemy defeats, demanding strategic allocation to maximize combat effectiveness and survival chances.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Combat Systems</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Introduces a weapon overheating mechanic to discourage relentless firing, encouraging diverse tactical engagement and careful management of offensive capabilities.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Enemy Spawning Dynamics</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Enemy waves evolve, increasing in intensity and frequency as time progresses, heightening the challenge and necessitating adaptive strategies.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Animation and Visual Design</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Utilizes Unreal Engine 5's Animation Blueprint for fluid enemy animations, dynamically responding to various gameplay scenarios like pursuits and confrontations, enhancing visual engagement and realism.</li>
</ul>
